## The Game of College (Learning How to Use Lambdas)

We will be building a board game, where a player rolls a dice and progresses through the board from Orientation to Graduation.

The Game class has a HashMap of all the text for each square indexed by square number.  You will need to complete the game.

- Create, in the Game class a similar HashMap, but one that contains Consumers to represent the action of each square.

- Finish the play method in the Driver so that the player actions stored in the HashMap above are executed.

You do not have to finish the test() method...but this might be helpful to you in troubleshooting, as it will exercise every square on the game board.
